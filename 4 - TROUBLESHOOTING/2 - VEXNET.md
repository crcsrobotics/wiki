# 4.2 - VEXnet Troubleshooting

## 4.2.1 - The VEXnet light isn't turning on (Cortex or Joystick).

The VEXnet light not turning on could indicate an issue with the firmware one of the VEXnet keys or devices.

### 4.2.1.1 - Bad VEXnet Firmware

Corrupted or outdated firmware can cause the VEXnet device to not be recognized.

1. See section `1.2` for instructions on updating the firmware of the devices.
2. Restart the updated Cortex and Joystick with updated VEXnet keys.

### 4.2.1.2 - Improper VEXnet Key

A VEXnet 1.0 key can cause the VEXnet keys to be unable to connect.

1. Check that both keys are VEXnet *2.0* keys.
2. If you have a VEXnet 1.0 key (black and does not say 2.0), request a new VEXnet key from BEST.

### 4.2.1.3 - Bad Joystick or VEXnet key.

A bad Joystick can cause the VEXnet key to stop working. Alternatively, the VEXnet key itself may be the issues. When this occurs, the light on the VEXnet key itself may turn on briefly and then turn off.

1. Test all other troubleshooting methods first.
2. Test the keys in a new Joystick if available.
3. Test different keys in the Joysticks if available.
4. If no other troubleshooting method words, or a test confirms which part isn't working, request new VEXnet Joystick or Key from BEST.

## 4.2.2 - VEXnet lights flashing yellow/not connecting.

The Cortex and Joystick can become unpaired on occasion.

1. Follow the pairing instructions in section `1.3.1`.
2. Reconnect the VEXnet keys.
3. Turn on the Cortex and Joystick.
4. Wait up to 30 seconds.

## 4.2.3 - VEXnet keeps disconnecting.

VEXnet is terrible. It just does this sometimes.

1. Check if other troubleshooting methods help.
2. Weep.
