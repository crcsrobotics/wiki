# 4.2 - VEXnet Troubleshooting

## 4.2.1 - The VEXnet light isn't turning on (Cortex or Joystick).

The VEXnet light not turning on could indicate an issue with the firmware one of the VEXnet keys or devices.

### 4.2.1.1 - Bad VEXnet Firmware

Corrupted or outdated firmware can cause the VEXnet device to not be recognized.

1. See section `1.2` for instructions on updating the firmware of the devices.
2. Restart the updated Cortex and Joystick with updated VEXnet keys.

### 4.2.1.2 - Improper VEXnet Key

A VEXnet 1.0 key can cause the VEXnet keys to be unable to connect.

1. Check that both keys are VEXnet *2.0* keys.
2. If you have a VEXnet 1.0 key (black and does not say 2.0), request a new VEXnet key from BEST.

### 4.2.1.3 - Bad Joystick

A bad Joystick can cause the VEXnet key to stop working. When this occurs, the light on the VEXnet key itself may turn on briefly and then turn off.

1. Test all other troubleshooting methods first.
2. Test the keys in a new Joystick if available.
3. If no other troubleshooting method words, or a test confirms that the keys work in another Joystick, request new VEXnet Joystick from BEST.
