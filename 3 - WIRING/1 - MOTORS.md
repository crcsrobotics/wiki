# 3.1 - Motor Wiring

The wiring order of the motors to the Cortex are listed below. Adjacent items are connected to each other.

## 3.1.1 - Large/Small Motors

- Cortex Motor Port 2-8 (*Do not attempt to use 1 or 10. These are against the rules.*)
- VEX Motor Controller
- Screw Terminal Motor Interface Cable (2-wire interface)
- Motor Screw Terminal (2-wire interface)
- Consumable Copper Wire (Solder to motor)
- Large/Small Motor

*Failure to follow this wiring configuration may result in the robot not being found in compliance, as occurred during the 2023 Incision Decision game. Only consumable wire may be soldered to the motors.*

## 3.1.2 - Servo Motors

- Motor Port 2-8 (*Do not attempt to use 1 or 10. These are against the rules.*)
- Servo Power Adapter Cable
- Servo Extension Cable (if needed for more wire length)
- Servo

Confirm that all servo wires are connected facing the correct way (white to white, black to black, red to red).
