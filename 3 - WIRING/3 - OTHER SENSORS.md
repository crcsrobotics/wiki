# 3.3 - Wiring Other Sensors

Generally, other sensors (such as limit switches) are connected using the setup below. Using sensors in RobotC is explained in section `2.3`.

Adjacent items are connected to each other.

- Cortex Sensor Port (Use a digital port for most sensors)
- Screw Terminal Sensor Interface Cable (3-wire interface)
- Sensor Screw Terminal (3-wire interface)
- Copper Wire
- Sensor

Sensor I/O wiring may not line up with the VEX Cortex sensor port wiring. Check the documentation for the VEX Cortex and the sensor if wiring is not working.
