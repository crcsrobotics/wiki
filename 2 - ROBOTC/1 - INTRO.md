# 2.1 - Intro to RobotC

RobotC is a C-like language that is easy-to-learn and well-documented. Additionally, the robotics team has an extensive library of RobotC code that can be viewed in `crcsrobotics` repositories. As such, the RobotC section of this wiki is focused on code. Instead, it will focus on how to use the tools RobotC (and its editor) provides to build code faster, do specific complicated tasks, and debug effectively.

For more complete documentation of the RobotC *language*, see [the Official RobotC Documentation](https://www.robotc.net/WebHelpVEX/index.htm).

This section does not cover Graphical RobotC, a drag-and-drop interface for RobotC. Although Graphical RobotC can be a helpful tool for learning basic concepts, it is very limited in its debug capabilities and what it can do. As such, it is usually not flexible enough to be used on the robot.
