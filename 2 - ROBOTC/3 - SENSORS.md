# 2.3 - Sensor Setup

Like motors, sensors are configured with the motor and sensors setup wizard.

Most BEST Robotics sensors are digital sensors, and should be set up in VEX Cortex Digital Senors ports 1-12.

BEST Robotics sensors are of type "Digital In".

Digital values are read using `SensorValue[sensorName]` and report either 0 or 1.
