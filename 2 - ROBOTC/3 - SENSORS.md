Like motors, sensors are configured with the motor and sensors setup wizard.

Most BEST Robotics sensors are digital sensors, and should be set up in VEX Cortex Digital Senors ports 1-12.

BEST Robotics sensors are of type "Digital In".

Digital values are read using `SensorValue[sensorName]` and report either 0 or 1.
